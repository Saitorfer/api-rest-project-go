# api-rest-project-go
 Just a little Go project

In this small project I lay the foundations of what will be a bigger application (from a personal project without open source). 

In this project I use some libraries
For GO REST : https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin
For api-tests we will use the extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client 
For DB: https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 ( based on GO doc: https://go.dev/wiki/SQLDrivers)
For Hash: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt 
Token: https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt
